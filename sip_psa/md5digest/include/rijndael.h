 * SIP-to-IMS Gateway - Rijndael
 * 
 *  \note Taken from 3GPP's TS 35.206
 * 
 *                      Rijndael Implementation
 *
 *  A sample 32-bit orientated implementation of Rijndael, the
 *  suggested kernel for the example 3GPP authentication and key
 *  agreement functions.
 *
 *  This implementation draws on the description in section 5.2 of
 *  the AES proposal and also on the implementation by
 *  Dr B. R. Gladman <brg@gladman.uk.net> 9th October 2000.
 *  It uses a number of large (4k) lookup tables to implement the
 *  algorithm in an efficient manner.
 *
 *  Note: in this implementation the State is stored in four 32-bit
 *  words, one per column of the State, with the top byte of the
 *  column being the _least_ significant byte of the word.
