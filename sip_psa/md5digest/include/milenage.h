 * SIP-to-IMS Gateway - Milenage
 * 
 *  \note Taken from 3GPP's TS 35.206
 * 
 *          Example algorithms f1, f1*, f2, f3, f4, f5, f5*
 *
 *  A sample implementation of the example 3GPP authentication and
 *  key agreement functions f1, f1*, f2, f3, f4, f5 and f5*.  This is
 *  a byte-oriented implementation of the functions, and of the block
 *  cipher kernel function Rijndael.
 *
 *  This has been coded for clarity, not necessarily for efficiency.
 *
 *  The functions f2, f3, f4 and f5 share the same inputs and have
 *  been coded together as a single function.  f1, f1* and f5* are
 *  all coded separately.
